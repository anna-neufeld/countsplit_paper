# Table1_coverage

The file coverage_res_analyze.R reads in results from the folders res.zip and cluster_res.zip (which must be unzipped in order to access) and creates Table 1.

The file sim_functions_cluster.R contains all functions that are used to run the coverage simualtions. These functions are called from the file run_sims_cluster.R. Note that this file was run numerous times in paralell on a computing cluster, necessitating the use of call_sim.sh and submit_sim.sh.

The folders res.zip and cluster_res.zip only contain a subset of the results that were created by running run_sims_cluster.R, so as to not exceed github's maximum folder size.
